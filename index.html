                <h4>Nonprofit Website Redesign</h4>
                <p>Rescue Dogs Rock's website is a non-profit organization 
                in New York City. The current website lacked clear messaging 
                and user-friendly navigation, resulting in reduced 
                adoptions and donations. The solution we found involved a 
                comprehensive redesign to highlight the organization's 
                mission, streamline the donation process, simplify 
                navigation, and improve branding consistency. 
                The project aims to increase adoptions and donations 
                by creating a visually appealing and user-friendly 
                website that effectively communicates Rescue Dogs Rock's 
                purpose and encourages user engagement.</p>
